# ViewTERM
A lightweight image viewer for the terminal.

- Its only dependency is Pillow, which you can get here: https://github.com/python-pillow/Pillow
- ViewTERM works best on smaller images - non-scalable ANSI characters means a fixed pixel size.
- I included two animation frames that are from my upcoming adventure game - coming to Github soon!
